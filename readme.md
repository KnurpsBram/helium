# HeliumðŸŽˆ
Helium doesn't actually change the pitch of your voice. 
It changes the speed of sound through the air. 
Your vocal cords move at the same frequency, but the air in your mouth _resonates_ at different frequencies!

With this web app - called **Helium** - you can play with changing the pitch and formants of your voice independently.
