# HeliumðŸŽˆ
It's a misconception that helium raises the pitch of your voice. 
It actually changes the speed of sound through the air. 
Your vocal cords create the same pitch, but the air in your mouth _resonates_ at different frequencies!

With this web app - called **Helium** - you can play with changing the pitch and formants of your voice independently. 

## Welcome to the Helium Suite

This is a fun little side project where I play with audio manipulations for speech. You can change the pitch, formants and tempo of your voice independently.
- Core library (audio manipulation functions such as `pitch_shift`, `time_stretch` and `helium`). Implemented with WORLD vocoder.
- Flask API (just a barebones GUI). Currently hosted on my raspberry pi! Please visit [86.83.9.1:5000/gui](http://86.83.9.1:5000/gui)
