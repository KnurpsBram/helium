# Helium
> It's a misconception that helium raises the pitch of your voice. The pitch of your voice stays the same, but because sound travels faster in helium than in air, it's the _resonance frequencies_ that go up.

Welcome to the Helium Suite. This is a fun little side project where I play with fun audio manipulations for speech. You can shift pitch independently of resonance frequencies (which are also called 'formants') and vice versa. You can also stretch time with or without changing pitch.
- Core library (audio manipulation functions such as `pitch_shift`, `time_stretch` and `helium`)
- Flask API (will come in the future)
- WebApp or Mobile App (will come in the future)
