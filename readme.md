# Helium
It's a misconception that helium raises the pitch of your voice. Your vocal cords move in the same way, so the pitch of your voice stays the same. But sound travels faster in helium than in air, so it's the _resonance frequencies_ that change.

Welcome to the Helium Suite.

This is a fun little side project where I play with fun audio manipulations for speech. You can shift pitch independently of resonance frequencies (resonance frequencies of speech are also called 'formants') and vice versa. You can also stretch time without changing pitch or formants.
- Core library (audio manipulation functions such as `pitch_shift`, `time_stretch` and `helium`)
- Flask API (will come in the future)
- WebApp or Mobile App (will come in the future)
